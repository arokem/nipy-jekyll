<h4>SciTran SDM delivers efficient and robust archiving, organization, and sharing of scientific data. We have developed the system around neuroimaging data, but our goal is to build a system that is flexible enough to accommodate all types of scientific data â€“ from paper-and-pencil tests to genomics data. SDM will also allow for the sharing of data and computations between remote sites.</h4>
